# hello-world
This is my first repository. All I did is enter the name of the repository and written the description about it which was optional. I was told to initialize this repository with a README.
I dont know if I am on the right track, but all i did after making new branch called readme-edits is to click on README.md and writing this. Now I have to write the commit message and click on the Commit changes button.
